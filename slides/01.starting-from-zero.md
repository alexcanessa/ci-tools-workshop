# Starting from ZERO

## CI & QA

----

> Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

---

## Our Objectives:

- Learn how to run some QA tests
- Delegate tests to a task runner
- Run the test task to stop broken pull requests

# Warning

## We're using ES6
*(which you know thanks to **papa**...)*

# Let's start

Use a brand new repo, an existing one ...

...or fork **/alexcanessa/ci-tools-workshp** <!-- .element class="highlight-red" -->

## What do you need?

Simply fork http://github.com/alexcanessa/ci-tools-workshp and run `npm install`, it's everything in the package.json already!

----

### 1. Config `.eslintrc.json`

[> Configuration docs](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)

#### Set the environment up

```json
{
	"env": {
		"node": true,
		"es6": true
	}
}
```

#### Add some rules

```json
{
	...,
	"rules": {
		"semi": [2, "always"]
	}
}
```

[See all rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/)

#### Use a plugin

You can use ready-to-use setups, such as [StandardJS](http://standardjs.com/), adding custom rules after this.
The file `.eslint-full.json` contains the plugin, which you already installed running `npm install`.

2. Config `Gruntfile.js`
